    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The Game <strong>Rocket league </strong>is a game created by <em>Psyonix</em> Rocket league is a soccar with a twist 
    instead of people you have cars, rocket league is my favorite game currently, and it is becoming free to play, 
    so if you enjoy games with alot of freedom you should definitly check this out.
    </p>
    <p>Rocket league is a game with a seemingly never ending list of mechanics just too name a few dribbling, power shots, 
    speed flips, and the list just goes on from there, I really enjoy this about the game because whenever I get bored of one 
    thing there are so many other things i can try.

    <h2>In game</h2>
    <p>In rocket league if you ever get bored in an online match, you have the option too do what ever you want 
    so try too up the tempo of the game, whenever this happens too me I usually go for an air dribble, something that for alot of 
    people in my rank is just about impossible, so when i do end up hitting one it feels realy good, and gives you something too aim for.

    <h3>Growing the game</h3>
    <p>This quote is by unkown: <q>Rocket league is a game with an ever growing skill ceiling.</q></p>
    <p>And this is so true it seems so often there is a new mechanic discovered in the game, and at 
        first most people think that no one will ever really use it, especially in a high level competitive game, but after a few 
        weeks when people get good at sure enogh someone ends up using it, then the rest of the players end up wanting to trying it, 
        and before long its just another mechanic.
